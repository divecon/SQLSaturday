CIFS demo:
Once the file share is shown, make a change to a text file on the linux side and show it on windows.
Do the opposite.
Create a table on windows data base that shows it is in windows.
Verify linux doesn't have that table.
Do a backup of AW on windows and restore to Linux.
Now show the table exists on Linux
